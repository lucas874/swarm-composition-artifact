\section{Reproducing experimental claims from Section 7.3}

To run the experiments documented in the paper please run the command:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{/ecoop25\_artifact/scripts/./run-benchmarks.sh}
\end{itemize}

This script will:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run the performance experiments described in the subparagraph `Performance Results' in the paper.
	\item Run the accuracy experiments described in the subparagraph `Accuracy Results' in the paper.
	\item Create the folder \texttt{process\_results/results} including the file out.pdf, which contains figures corresponding to Figure 7 and Figure 8 from the paper.  
\end{enumerate}

The absolute value of the reported execution times may vary from system to system, but the relationship between the execution times of the two algorithms should be as shown in the paper. 

%The reported execution times may vary from system to system 

%Appendix

%For all experimental claims made in the paper, please explain how this claim can be reproduced with the artifact

%For example: “The data in table 1 can be obtained by running script ‘generatei\_table1.sh’”

%Please note:

%    we highly advise authors to provide a push-button evaluation (cf. call for artifacts);
%    only artifacts allowing reproduction of all experimental claims will receive the functional badge.
